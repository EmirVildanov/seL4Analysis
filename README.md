## Student's notes appended during exploration of verification system of seL4 microkernel

This repo contains report and notes appeared during university course work based on exploration of seL4 microkernel verification system. The main goal of the work was to define code requirements that verification systems brings and find some alternative to combination of using C + Isabelle/HOL for creation of secure OS.
 * Presentation.pdf — defense presentation in Russian;
 * Report.pdf — defense report in Russian;
 * Global_notes.md — notes about main logic of verification system, microkernel with useful links.
 * MIRAI_experiments.md — notes about start of MIRAI use.
 * VSCode_analysis_of_theorems.md — notes, appeared during Isabelle/HOL theoremes using VSCode.
 * /haskell_playground — folder with dumb Haskell project for Haskell syntax and logic exploration (useful for understanding functional layer of verification system)
 * /mirai_playground — folder with dumb Rust project for exploration of MIRAI opportunities
