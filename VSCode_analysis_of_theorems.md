* verum = T = truth

* Usual formal language semantics (os Programming language) is operational
* Denotation = mathematical object that describes expression from the language
* "Denotational semantics is ascribed to a program phrase as a function from an environment (holding the current values of its free variables) to its denotation. For example, the phrase n*m produces a denotation when provided with an environment that has binding for its two free variables: n and m. If in the environment n has the value 3 and m has the value 5, then the denotation is 15."
